# Employee Attrition Analysis


## Overview

A data-driven understanding of the workforce is key to addressing employee attrition. This project aims to analyze employee attrition patterns using SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for visualization. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains various employee attributes, including demographics, job satisfaction, career growth, and work-life balance. Through SQL queries and visualization, we extract meaningful insights to understand the factors influencing employee retention and turnover.

A research paper by **Singh et al. (2019)** suggests that the causes of attrition in an organization can be traced from the following factors: internal causes, instability in leadership, lack of flexibility, lack of job security, external causes and individual/personal causes. The exploratory data analysis will use these references as guides for focus area in the dataset. 

A journal article from [**Personio**](https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/attrition-rate/#what-is-considered-a-high-employee-attrition-rate), Europe's leading HR software provider, notes that while attrition rates vary by company size, an annual attrition rate above 20% is a cause for concern and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, [**Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)**](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/attrition-definition-types-causes-mitigation-tips), a professional organization for human resources professionals, recommends that organizations should desire a target of attrition rate below 10%.

*Note:* The dataset lacks a specific timestamp, so for analysis purposes, we assume it represents a one-year period.

This is a **synthetic** dataset generated by the IBM Data Scientists.

## Business Problem

To simulate a real-world case, this project assumes a fictional organization facing a steady increase in employee attrition. Management is growing concerned, as the rising turnover not only escalates recruitment and training costs but is also beginning to impact team morale and project delivery timelines.


## Objective:

Identify the key factors driving employee attrition and propose actionable strategies to improve employee retention — particularly among high-risk groups.

Questions to ask:

1. Which group shows high attrition rates?
2. Are there patterns across variables?
3. What actionable insights could the organization gain from these trends?


## Data Import

The dataset was imported into pgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL) for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). SQL was used to manipulate and structure the data, generate insights, and prepare it for visualization in Power BI.


## Data Cleaning, Standardization & Definitions

- The dataset was in good condition upon import. There are no duplicates, null and missing values in the dataset after double checking in SQL.

- To improve clarity and ensure consistency, the following changes were made in the dataset:  

    - A total of eight columns were dropped since these columns either provide redundant information or have minimal impact on key insights.  
    - Certain ambiguous labels in the dataset were standardized to align with common HR terminology.  
    - Adjusted column names for readability (e.g., EnvironmentSatisfaction → environment_satisfaction).  


- Standardization for *education* column (level of education achieved):

    - 1 "Below College" → High School
    - 2 "College" → Undergraduate
    - 5 "Doctor" → Doctorate
    - Other education levels remain unchanged (Bachelor, Master) 


- Monthly Income Distribution:

    - Since income distribution is skewed, with most employees earning below $6K, we categorized salaries into percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) for a more balanced analysis.


- Variable Definitions:

    *environment_satisfaction:* Reflects contentment with the overall work environment, including workspace conditions and available resources.   

    *job_satisfaction:* Reflects how content an employee is with their job, work environment, and responsibilities. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.  

    *percent_salary_hike:* Represents the percentage increase in an employee’s salary over time, which may impact retention and motivation.

    *relationship_satisfaction:* Measures an employee’s satisfaction with workplace relationships (colleagues, supervisors, subordinates).  

    *work_life_balance:* Represents how employees perceive their ability to balance work responsibilities with personal life, which can be a significant factor in employee satisfaction and retention. Higher scores indicates better balance and satisfaction.  


The dataset originates from Kaggle, while additional metadata and variable interpretations were referenced from INSEAD Analytics' project on IBM HR Attrition to ensure alignment with the dataset's intended use.

## Dataset Overview:

Taking a look at the data structure after data cleaning and standardization.

- Total Rows: 1470
- Total Columns (after cleaning): 27
- Data Types: Categorical (character) and Ordinal/Numerical (integer)
- Target Variable: attrition ('Yes'/'No')
- Key Domains Covered (focus area):
  - Demographics: age, gender, education, marital_status
  - Job Details: department, job_role
  - Job Fulfillment: job_satisfaction, environment_satisfaction, relationship_satisfaction
  - Compensation: monthly_income, percent_salary_hike
  - Work-Life Balance: overtime, work_life_balance, business_travel
  - Career Progression: years_since_last_promotion, years_in_current_role, training_count_prev_year


## Dataset Limitations

1. The dataset does not contain date columns, limiting our ability to analyze trends over time.

2. It does not track the number of promotions an employee has received, only the years since their last promotion.

3. Employees with 0 years_since_last_promotion are assumed to have been recently promoted, but without a timeline or count of promotion, we cannot confirm when the promotion occurred or how many times an employee was promoted to properly see career progression.

4. Human Resources department has low headcount compared to Sales and Research & Development. Skewed or disproportioned attrition rates are to be expected when viewed or observed through different attrition factors.

These limitations affect how we interpret the insights gained as we analyze the dataset.


# Who Are Our Employees?

Understanding the people behind the data is important than simply seeing them as numbers. By getting to know who they are, we can better understand the groups they represent and the reasons behind their choices. This dataset includes 1,470 employees across various age groups, genders, education levels and marital statuses. This reflects a diverse workforse across different backgrounds and career stages.


## Gender and Age

Let’s begin by exploring the age and gender distribution in the dataset. Understanding how these demographics are represented helps build context before diving into the attrition analysis.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/gender_distribution.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/age_distribution.png" width="45%" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/min_max_avg_age.png" width="45%" />
</p>


**Gender Distribution:** The employee population consists of 60% male and 40% female, showing a relatively balanced distribution.   


**Age Distribution:** Employees range in age from 18 to 60 years old, with an average age of 37. We can also see in the graph that there's a large volume of population between 25 to 45 years old - which are critical years for career progression and development. This makes it an important part of employee retention as mid-career years are often where opportunities, challenges and work-life balance decisions converges.


## Education Level and Marital Status


**Education Distribution:** The graph shows that most employees hold a Bachelor's degree, nearly 600 individuals, followed by around 400 with a Master's degree. These two groups represent the primary educational backgrounds in the workforce.


**Marital Status Distribution:** The distribution indicates that a significant proportion of employees are married, followed by those who are single and divorced. This presents an opportunity for further analysis, as employee turnover can be significantly influenced by personal life choices and responsibilities.

  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/marital_status_distribution.png" width="45%" />
</p>


## Job Details

Let's also take a look at the distribution of employees by department and job role to understand the organization's structure. 


**Department Distribution:** The department with the highest employee count is Research and Development, making up over 60% of the overall volume of employee population, followed by Sales, and then Human Resources.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/department_distribution.png" width="50%" />
</p>


**Job Role Distribution:** The graph shows that Sales Executive role has the largest volume of employee population, followed by Research Scientist and Laboratory Technician, consecutively. These top three roles account for more than half of the total population size when combined.

# Understanding Why Employees Leave: An Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that we that we understand who the employees are, let’s uncover why they leave. 
Our main objective here is to conduct an analysis to evaluate whether specific factors are associated with significant employee turnover rates and if there are patterns across various groups and variables. 

The overall attrition rate stands at 16.12%, with 237 out of 1,470 employees having left the organization. While this is below the 20% threshold considered high by [**Personio**](https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/attrition-rate/#what-is-considered-a-high-employee-attrition-rate), it still raises concern and is worth investigating as companies should strive for an attrition rate of below 10% (Ruehl, 2014).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Overview/overall_attrition_rate.png" width="50%" />
</p>


## Demographics and Attrition Analysis

This section analyzes attrition rates across major demographic groups to pinpoint those with the highest risk of leaving the organization.


1. **Age** - The graph indicates that the 18-24 group shows the highest attrition rate at 39.18%, followed by 25-34 group at 20.22%. Together, these two segments account for over 60% of total attrition cases (150 out of 237 attrition count), placing them in most at-risk. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Demographics%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/age_group_attrition_rate.png" width="50%" />
</p>


2. **Gender** - Attrition is fairly balanced between male and female employees, with males showing a slightly higher rate.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Demographics%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/gender_attrition_rate.png" width="50%" />
</p>


3. **Education** - Education levels also shows a farily balanced attrition rate across all groups, with the rate decreasing towards Doctorate degree holders.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Demographics%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/education_level_attrition_rate.png" width="50%" />
</p>


4. **Marital Status** - Attrition appears significantly higher among single employees, who leave at more than twice the rate of their divorced counterparts. Their attrition rate exceeds that of married employees by 13%, suggesting relationship status may influence employee turnover.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Demographics%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/marital_status_attrition_rate.png" width="50%" />
</p>


### **Exploratory analysis across high attrition variables**  

1. Is there a pattern in attrition across each group?
2. Which group are most at-risk?


### Findings:


#### 1. Age and Marital Status

- The single employees in the 18–24 age group stand out with 50% or half of their population leaving the organization, followed by married employees at a 30% attrition rate. High attrition among single employees persists in the 25-34 age group. Notably, the 55–64 age group appears to have a high attrition rate among single employees, but this is more likely related to retirement or career transitions than disengagement. 

- We can see a pattern of high attrition among young and single employees, which puts them most at risk in employee turnover.

</p>


## Job Details and Attrition Analysis

Analyzing attrition by department and job role provides a more targeted view of which positions are most affected.


1. **Department** - Sales and Human Resources both show significantly higher attrition rate than Research and Development, with rates nearing the 20% mark. However, it’s important to note that Human Resources has the lowest headcount, meaning that the employee turnover is more noticeable within that department. Sales, by contrast, combines both a high rate and a larger population, making its attrition more impactful in absolute terms.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Details%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/department_attrition_rate.png" width="45%" />
</p>


2. **Job Role** - Sales Representative shows the highest attrition rate at 39.76%, standing out with a notable 15% gap from the subsequent roles, Laboratory Technician and Human Resources.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Details%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_role_attrition_rate.png" width="45%" />
</p>


### **Exploratory across high attrition variables**  

1. Which age groups contribute most significantly to attrition across departments and job roles?
2. How does attrition by marital status vary across departments and job roles?


### Findings:


#### 1. Demographics and Job Role

- Younger employees (18-24 and 25–34) are heavily concentrated in entry-level roles—Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Research Scientists—all of which consistently show above-average attrition. In contrast, older employees (35+) are more likely to occupy stable, higher-paying roles (Managers, Research Directors, Manufacturing Directors), where attrition is markedly lower. This highlights that attrition risk is driven not just by age, but by the types of roles younger employees typically hold.

- Human Resources (Staff) shows high attrition rate on younger age group as well, again due to the department and role's particular low headcount.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Details%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_role_and_age_group_attrition_rate.png" width="100%" />
</p>

- Entry-level roles—Sales Representative, Laboratory Technician, Research Scientist, and Human Resources staff—along with Sales Executives, show the highest attrition rates among single employees across marital status groups. Notably, Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians lead this trend, emphasizing that young, single employees dominate these high-turnover roles.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Details%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_role_and_marital_status_attrition_rate.png" width="100%" />
</p>


### Why are these groups more likely to leave?

Could it be a sense of exploration that comes with youth? Or perhaps the freedom and flexibility of being single that presents job mobility more appealing? Or there's a more underlying reasons behind these numbers? Let’s explore work-related factors to uncover deeper drivers of attrition.


## Job Fulfillment and Attrition Analysis

This section examines whether work-related factors—specifically job fulfillment indicators such as environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction—significantly influence attrition rates. Understanding these relationships can provide insight into the motivations and decision-making patterns of employees who chose to leave, helping identify which fulfillment factors have the strongest impact on turnover risk.


1. **Job Fulfillment Factors** - Across job, environment, and relationship satisfaction, employees who rated their experience as "Low" exhibited attrition rates that is significantly higher than the range observed for all other satisfaction levels. This consistent pattern suggests that low fulfillment in any core area may elevate attrition risk.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_fulfillment_attrition.png" width="50%" />
</p>


### Exploratory analysis across high attrition variables

1. How do the demographics and job details variables interact with job fulfillment factors?
2. Are there significant differences across satisfaction levels-from Low to Very High?
3. Do any patterns emerge consistently across categories?


### Findings:


#### 1. Job Fulfillment and Demographics

-  Whether satisfaction is Low, Medium, High, or Very High, young employees, particularly in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups, still shows elavated attrition rates with the most overall attrition cases.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_fulfillment_factors_and_age_group.png" width="100%" />
</p>


- Single employees consistently show the highest attrition rates across all job fulfillment factors, regardless of satisfaction level. Those reporting Low satisfaction exhibit the highest turnover percentages in Environment, Job, and Relationship Satisfaction, highlighting a significant and vulnerable demographic segment at risk of disengagement

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_fulfillment_factors_and_marital_status.png" width="100%" />
</p>


#### 2. Job Fulfillment and Job Role  

This section shifts its focus on how job roles within each department behave across varying levels of job fulfillment categories.


#### Environment Satisfaction


  - **Sales Department**

    Sales Representative shows the highest attrition rates across all satisfaction levels, indicating persistent turnover challenges regardless of workplace conditions. Sales Executives with Low satisfaction shows noticeable attrition rates which decreases as the satisfaction level increases.


  - **Research & Development Department**

    Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists show elevated attrition rates in both Low to Very High satisfaction levels, with the Low category contributing the most turnover cases in the department.


  - **Human Resources Department**

    HR Staff are the only roles contributing to attrition across all environment satisfaction levels in this department with Low satisfaction driving the highest turnover.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/environment_satisfaction_and_job_role_attrition.png" width="100%" />
</p>


#### Job Satisfaction


  - **Sales Department**
   
    Across all satisfaction levels from Low to Very High, the Sales Representative role consistently shows the highest attrition rates, indicating persistent disengagement regardless of satisfaction score. This is followed by Sales Executive role with their attrition rate diminishing as the the satisfaction increases. Managerial roles exhibit minimal attrition, suggesting greater role stability even when satisfaction varies.


  - **Research & Development Department**

    Laboratory Technicians show high attrition rates under both Low and High satisfaction levels. Attrition remains present even under Medium and Very High satisfaction, signaling deeper issues. Research Scientist follows, with attrition under Low, Medium, and High satisfaction levels.


  - **Human Resources Department**

    HR Staff report attrition at every satisfaction level, with Low satisfaction associated with the highest attrition rate.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/job_satisfaction_and_job_role_attrition.png" width="100%" />
</p>


#### Relationship Satisfaction


  - **Sales Department**
    
    Sales Representatives still consistently shows high attrition rates across all satisfaction levels, a pattern to view for employee disengagement in their roles. Sales Executives also experience attrition at every level, with the highest turnover observed at High satisfaction—followed by Low and Very High. Managerial roles show isolated attrition cases, one each at Low and Very High satisfaction levels though it is worth noting that the rate skewed due to low headcount.


  - **Research & Development Department**
    
    Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists role also consistently shows disengagement with elavated attrition rates in different satisfaction levels, suggesting role-specific stressors that go beyond interpersonal satisfaction.


  - **Human Resources Department**

    HR Staff report attrition at every relationship satisfaction level, with High producing the highest attrition rate.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Job%20Fulfillment%20Factors%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/relationship_satisfaction_and_job_role_attrition.png" width="100%" />
</p>


## Compensation and Attrition Analysis

This section analyzes compensation factors—monthly income and percent salary hike—to assess their impact on attrition. Identifying whether pay level and salary growth contribute to turnover helps determine if compensation is a primary driver of employee exits.


1. **Monthly Income and Percent Salary Hike** - Employees who left had a lower average monthly income than those who stayed, while their average percent salary hike showed no difference.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/monthly_income_average_by_attrition_status.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/percent_salary_hike_average_by_attrition_status.png" width="45%" />
</p>


### Exploratory analysis across high attrition variables

1. How do demographics and job details interact with compensation factors in relation to attrition?
2. Are there noticeable differences in attrition rates across compensation levels?
3. Do consistent patterns emerge across categories, suggesting that compensation is (or isn’t) a key driver of turnover?


### Findings:


#### 1. Compensation and Demographics


  - **Age Group**

    - Across all age groups, employees who left consistently earned less than those who stayed. Younger leavers-already identified as high-risk in previous analyses-earned below their respective department averages (which we will see in the following segments), suggesting that perceived pay inequity may contribute to early-career turnover. 


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/monthly_income_average_and_age_group_by_attrition_status.png" width="60%" />
</p>


  - **Marital Status**

    - Employees who left also earned less across marital status groups, with the largest gaps among single and divorced employees. This aligns with earlier findings where single employees consistently showed higher attrition rates, suggesting compensation dissatisfaction may reinforce their likelihood of leaving.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/monthly_income_average_and_marital_status_by_attrition_status.png" width="60%" />
</p>


#### 2. Compensation and Job Details


#### Department Level


  - **Monthly Income and Department**

    There is a clear pay gap between employees who left and those who stayed across all departments—indicating that compensation plays a significant role in employees’ decisions to leave the company. Addressing this gap, particularly in lower-paying roles, could help reduce early-career turnover and improve retention.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/monthly_income_average_by_department.png" width="45%" />

</p>


#### Job Role Level


  - **Monthly Income and Job Role**

    Lower-paying roles (Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Research Scientists) show both below-average salaries and high attrition, reinforcing their position as high-risk groups already flagged in earlier analyses. Interestingly, a few higher-paying roles (e.g., Healthcare Representatives and Sales Executives) show leavers earning more than those who stayed, hinting that factors beyond pay—such as workload or career mobility—may drive attrition in these roles.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Compensation%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/monthly_income_average_by_job_role.png" width="45%" />

</p>


  - **Percent Salary Hike and Job Role**

    Across all job roles, percent salary hikes are relatively uniform, with most averages clustering around 15–16%, suggesting limited differentiation in how raises are distributed. However, a consistent trend emerges: employees who left tend to receive slightly lower salary hikes than those who stayed. While the differences are modest, they may reinforce perceived inequities, especially in roles that already experience high turnover. Interestingly, Research Scientists show the opposite pattern implying that factors beyond compensation, such as workload, growth opportunities, or job satisfaction—drive attrition in this role.

<p align="center">

</p>


## Work-Life Balance Factors and Attrition Analysis

Work-life balance factors are critical in understanding employee turnover, as they often reflect job demands and organizational support. In this section, we analyze three key indicators—business travel frequency, overtime, and perceived work-life balance levels—to determine how they influence attrition. Each factor is examined individually, followed by cross-analysis with previously identified high-risk demographics and job roles to uncover deeper patterns.


1. **Business Travel** - Employees who travel frequently show a significantly higher attrition rate (24.9%) compared to those who travel rarely or not at all. While the majority of turnover cases come from the "Travel Rarely" group due to its larger population, the disproportionately high attrition rate among frequent travelers suggests that heavy travel demands may contribute to burnout or dissatisfaction.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Work-Life%20Balance%20Level%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/business_travel_attrition_rate.png" width="45%" />

</p>


2. **Overtime** - Employees working overtime show a much higher attrition rate (30.5%) compared to those who don’t (10.4%)—indicating that extended work hours are a strong turnover driver.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Stinrb/hr-attrition-analysis/blob/main/visualizations/Work-Life%20Balance%20Level%20and%20Attrition%20Analysis/overtime_attrition_rate.png" width="45%" />

</p>


3. **Work-life Balance Level** - Employees with a Low work-life balance (31.25% attrition) show the highest turnover risk, reinforcing that poor balance strongly drives attrition. While attrition rates decline as perceived balance improves, even employees reporting Very High balance still leave at a notable 17.65%, suggesting that other factors, such as compensation, career growth or job fulfillement factors which may outweigh work-life balance for some groups.

</p>


### Exploratory analysis across high attrition variables

1. How do work-life balance factors interact with at-risk demographics and job role?
2. Which combinations of factors show the highest attrition rates, and are they concentrated in specific job roles or demographics?
3. Do any groups show unexpectedly high attrition despite favorable conditions?


### Findings:


#### 1. Work-Life Balance Factors and Demographics


#### Business Travel


  - **Age Group**

    Employees in roles requiring frequent travel show significantly higher attrition rates, particularly among the 18–24 and 25–34 age groups—already identified as high-risk in earlier analyses. Notably, even employees aged 45–64 exhibit elevated attrition in travel-intensive roles, suggesting that frequent business travel can impact retention across demographics.

</p>


  - **Marital Status**

    Frequent business travel consistently shows the highest attrition rates across all marital status groups, with Single employees being the most affected (38.54%). Married and Divorced employees show comparatively lower attrition, but rates still rise notably when frequent travel is required. This reinforces earlier findings that frequent travel is a strong attrition driver, particularly among demographics already at higher risk.

</p>


#### Overtime


  - **Age Group**

    Required overtime shows consistently higher attrition rates across all age groups, with the most striking impact on younger employees (18–24 at 67.7% and 25–34 at 40.4%). While older age groups show lower overall attrition, overtime still nearly doubles their likelihood of leaving compared to those not required to work extra hours. This reinforces the earlier pattern that younger employees are more sensitive to workload pressures, making overtime a critical attrition driver across demographics.

</p>


  - **Marital Status**

    Overtime-required roles show the highest attrition rates across all marital status groups, with Single employees being the most affected (50%), leaving at nearly 3x the rate of their non-overtime counterpart (49.6% vs 16%). Married (23.1%) and Divorced (19.2%) employees also show a notable jump in attrition when overtime is required compared to roles not required to work extra hours. This reinforces overtime as a key attrition driver, particularly for Single employees which are already flagged as a high-risk group in earlier analyses.

</p>


#### Work-Life Balance Level


  - **Age Group**

    Lower-level roles such as Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Research Scientists show high attrition across all work-life balance levels, even among those reporting High or Very High balance. This suggests that factors beyond perceived balance, such as career growth or compensation, drive turnover in these roles. Conversely, higher-paying roles like Managers and Research Directors maintain consistently low attrition regardless of work-life balance ratings.

</p>


  - **Marital Status**

    Attrition rates are highest at low work-life balance levels across all marital status groups, with Single employees showing the steepest risk (48%). While attrition decreases as work-life balance improves, Single employees continue to record higher rates than their Married and Divorced counterparts even at High and Very High levels, suggesting that factors beyond work-life balance may influence their decision to leave.

#### 2. Work-Life Balance Factors and Job Details


  - **Business Travel and Job Role**

    At-risk roles requiring frequent business travel show significantly higher attrition rates compared to their counterparts, with Sales Representatives, Laboratory Technicians, and Research Scientists among the most affected. This suggests that travel demands may amplify turnover risk in already vulnerable roles.

</p>


  - **Overtime and Job Role**

    Roles requiring overtime consistently show much higher attrition rates compared to those that don’t. At-risk roles already highlighted in earlier segments are the most affected—Sales Representatives (66.7%), Laboratory Technicians (50%), and Research Scientists (34%) stand out, reinforcing their vulnerability. Even roles with moderate overall attrition, like Sales Executives (33%), see a notable increase under required overtime.

</p>


  - **Work-Life Balance Level and Job Role**

    At-risk roles show persistently high attrition regardless of perceived work-life balance levels. Sales Representatives stand out, with an exceptionally high 88.9% attrition rate even at a Very High work-life balance level, suggesting that factors beyond balance, such as job demands, compensation, or limited career mobility, drive turnover in this group. Laboratory Technicians also record the highest attrition at Low balance (70%) and remain elevated across other levels, indicating ongoing role-related pressures. Sales Executives follow a similar pattern, with attrition concentrated in Low to Medium balance levels and Research Scientist on Very High Level. These findings suggest that improving work-life balance alone may not significantly reduce attrition for these roles

## Career Progression and Attrition Analysis

Career growth and skill development play a critical role in employee retention. This segment examines three key indicators of progression within the organization: tenure in current role (years in current role), time since last promotion (years since last promotion), and development opportunities (training count in the previous year). These factors can provide insight into whether limited upward mobility or lack of professional growth contributes to attrition. Additionally, to understand whether career progression interacts with compensation, monthly income will be analyzed across these variables to identify high-risk patterns.


1. **Job Role Tenure** - Employees who left the organization generally had shorter tenure in their current roles compared to those who stayed, suggesting limited career progression opportunities may influence attrition.

</p>


2. **Average Year Since Last Promotion** - The data reveals that shorter promotion cycles are generally associated with higher retention, as most employees who stayed had slightly more recent promotions than those who left. It is also noteworthy that the Research Director role, with an average of 14 years since last promotion, may have experienced attrition due to retirement or late-career exits, rather than promotion-related dissatisfaction.

</p>


3. **Average Training Count (Previous Year)** - The average training count from the previous year shows minimal differences between employees who stayed and those who left, indicating that training frequency alone may not strongly influence attrition. However, a few exceptions stand out, Research Directors who left had the lowest average training count (1 training), which may suggest a lack of ongoing development opportunities or reflect end-of-career dynamics.

### Exploratory analysis across high attrition variables

 
1. How does monthly income vary across job role tenure, and does it correlate with higher attrition rates?


### Findings:


#### Job Role Tenure and Monthly Income

  Across most roles, employees who left the organization tend to have shorter tenure and slightly lower monthly income compared to those who stayed. This pattern may suggest that slower pay progression in early tenure may influence attrition. However, exceptions exist: Sales Executives who left had a slightly higher average income despite shorter tenure, hinting that factors beyond compensation—such as workload or job satisfaction—may drive turnover in sales roles. High-income, senior roles like Managers and Research Directors show attrition at advanced tenures, likely due to retirement or late-career transitions rather than compensation dissatisfaction.

## Overall Key Insights

1. Which group shows high attrition rates?
2. Are there patterns across variables?
3. What actionable insights could the organization gain from these trends?


### Findings:


1. **High-Risk Demographics**

    - **Single employees** aged **18–34** are the most attrition-prone, contributing the largest share of turnover across all variables.

2. **At-Risk Job Roles**

    - **Sales Representative, Laboratory Technician, Research Scientist, Sales Executive, and Human Resources staff** show consistently high attrition rates.

    - **Entry-level roles (Sales Rep, Lab Technician, Research Scientist, HR Staff)** are heavily populated by **young, and single employees** who left, making them primary drivers of attrition.

3. **Compensation & Workload Patterns**

    - **Entry-level roles (Sales Rep, Lab Technician, Research Scientist, HR Staff)** suffer from **low compensation and heavy workload**, which results in job disengagement despite reporting high work-life balance and job fulfillment in surveys, and a fair increase in percentage salary hike.

    - **Sales Executives** face attrition despite above-average income, primarily due to **heavy workload (frequent travel, overtime) and low work-life balance**.

4. **HR Staff Note**

    - **Human Resources (Staff)** attrition rates appear skewed due to **low headcount** but remain vulnerable to similar **workload and compensation issues**.

5. **Career Progression & Training**

    - Training & promotions have **limited** retention impact on entry-level roles but are more valuable for **upper-level roles (Managers, Research Directors)** where career growth opportunities reduce turnover.

6. **Managerial Positions**

    - Most of the upper echelon roles are stable when compared to the more at-risk groups. It is worth noting that their skewed attrition rates are mainly due to **low headcount** when paired with attrition factors.


### Actionable Recommendations:


1. **Targeted Retention for High-Risk Demographics**

    - Develop retention initiatives specifically for young, single employees, such as career mentoring, early promotion pathways, or flexible work arrangements.

2. **Reassess Compensation & Workload Balance**

    - Review salary structures for entry-level roles with heavy workloads (Sales Rep, Lab Technician, Research Scientist) to ensure pay aligns with job demands.

    - Introduce workload optimization (e.g., redistribute overtime, reduce unnecessary travel).

3. **Improve Work Environment Beyond Surveys**

    - Address actual work conditions—not just perceived satisfaction—by evaluating overtime requirements, travel frequency, and realistic work-life balance for critical roles.

4. **Career Growth for Key Roles**

    - Provide structured promotion and development opportunities for upper-level roles to maintain long-term engagement.

    - For entry-level roles, offer skill-building programs that lead to visible internal mobility opportunities.

5. **HR Role Retention Check**

    - Investigate HR workload and compensation despite low headcount, as even small turnover in HR can significantly affect organizational stability.
